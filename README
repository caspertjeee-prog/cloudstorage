A little domain to call your own

I’m born from your name, each letter a key
Count through the alphabet and write down with me.
The tenth comes first, then the fifteenth in line,
Eighteenth, the ninth, the eleventh -> combine.
Press us together, all digits in place,
And you’ll find a code only yours to embrace.

Not .com, not .net, but something more free,
A home without borders, fluid as sea.
An ending that shifts, adapts, and can grow
A space for your dreams, wherever they flow.

A decade to keep, a gift made to last
A door to tomorrow, not chained to the past.

Congrats.
